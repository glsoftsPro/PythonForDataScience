Here in this I develop some data science projects and teaching python for people who interested to learn Machine Leaning.

So before we start lets create python environment in your pc/laptop.

Getting Python for Windows and MacBook

Install Python from offical website: https://python.org/download

if you are using MacBook or windows  then download the newer version of  python (python 3.7.1) for MacOS X qnd windows.

Getting Python for Linux.

In linux the python is pre-installed. So Check if python is installed in your operating System or not.

Step1: Python --version (if python is already installed in your computer then no need to do second step.)

Step2: 

//On Debian derivatives such as Ubuntu, use APT:

$sudo apt-get install python3

//On Red Hat and derivatives, use yum:

$sudo yum install python 

//On SUSE and derivatives, use zypper:

$ sudo zypper install python3

Step3: Open Terminel or Command Prompt and check if python installed correctly or not.

$ Python --version

So we are completed with setuping python environment in our computers.

Install Python Dependencies required for DataScience. Here I mentioned some python mechine learning libraries for DataScience.

Step1: Install Python Pip.

$ pip install -U pip

Step2: Install python dependencies.
